# __**Tweak Patch Notes**__

## Modified Zodiacs
Zodiacs have become less impactful (or impactful in a different way). They were far too powerful.<br> 
Aries (Four-kind) - Destroys 1 card not of the rank played.<br> 
Taurus (Three-kind) - Converts 2 cards to rusty.<br> 
Gemini (Pair) - No changes.<br> 
Cancer (Flush House) - Each card has a 1 in 2 chance to convert to one in the Flush House. Each converted card has a 1 in 2 chance to gain an enhancement.<br> 
Leo (Flush Five) - Each of the first 3 cards has a 1 in 3 chance to convert to the central card.<br> 
Virgo (Five-kind) - Each of the central 3 cards has a 1 in 3 chance to duplicate.<br> 
Libra (Full House) - Leftmost card in hand has a 2 in 3 chance to turn into the second scored card.<br> 
Scorpio (High Card) - Each unscored card has a 1 in 3 chance to become stone or ore.<br> 
Sagittarius (Flush) - Each card in hand has a 1 in 2 chance to become the suit of the flush.<br> 
Capricorn (Straight) - Each scored card has a 1 in 2 chance to turn into an index card.<br> 
Pisces (Straight Flush) - Each card in hand is converted to the suit of the Straight Flush, and each converted card has a 1 in 4 chance to gain a random edition.<br>
*Negative* edition is strongly weighted against, but still possible.<br> 
<br> 
All Zodiacs also have better visuals and additional sound design. Pops and nice little delays and such.

## Changed Card & Pack Rarities
Zodiac and Loteria cards are less common. Their packs are also less common.
This is designed partly to help counterweight their inclusion in modpacks.

## Buffed Vouchers
Some of the vouchers added for Loteria and Zodiac packs & cards now increase their commonness, on top of their original effects.
This counterweights the slightly increased rarity of the cards and their packs, but also opens up several avenues to choose to see them more or less often during a run.

## Fixed Bugs
Small Blinds no longer pay out on red stake or higher.<br> 
Blinds properly save and load their statuses. Before, saving and loading while in a big or small blind, then beating it, would beat the boss blind instead and reset the ante.<br> 
Fixed The Tarot not working with modded rankless cards, and some other hands that should score involving rankless cards.

## Nerfed Soil
Down to x0.5 per repeatedly scored rank from x0.75. That's it.
